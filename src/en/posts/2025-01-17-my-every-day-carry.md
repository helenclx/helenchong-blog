Inspired by [Alexandra Wolfe](https://alexink.ca/)'s [Every Day Carry (EDC) post](https://alexink.ca/2024/12/17/my-edc.html), I would like to talk about the things I carry every day as well.

## Wallet

I have a wallet to store cash, including both banknotes and coins. My wallet also contains my identification card, blood group card, and a Malaysian National Registration Department letter about my thumbprint being potentially unreadable by sensors. Due to me having thin fingerprints, some fingerprint sensors have a hard time detecting my prints.

## Clip-on Sunglasses

I have [retinitis pigmentosa](2024-12-21-living-with-retinitis-pigmentosa.md), with my symptoms including my eyes being sensitive to bright light, including sunlight, to the extent that I find it difficult to see things under sunlight. As a result, I need to bring clip-on sunglasses to attach to my regular glasses whenever I go outside my home.

## Phone

My phone's model is Redmi Note 13 Pro 5G, and my phone serves as my communication device and camera of choice.

## Tissues

I have a nose that is allergic to dust in particular, so bringing tissues with me is a good idea in case I suffer from allergic rhinitis when my allergy is triggered.

## Pen

I bring an ordinary black ink ball pen with me for situations where I need to write on some paper.

## Water Bottle

I always prepared a bottle of water before going out to keep myself hydrated.

## Cross Body Bag

All the above items are placed in a cross body bag that I carry whenever I go outside the house.
