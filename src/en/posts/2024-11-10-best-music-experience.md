The question from the November 2024 [WeblogPoMo AMA](https://weblogpomo.club/challenges) blogging challenge that I would like to answer today is: **"What’s the best music-related experience of your life so far?"** This question was originally asked by [Hiro](https://www.hiro.report/) and [answered](https://gabz.blog/posts/the-best-music-related-experience) by [Gabz](https://gabz.blog/).

The best and most unforgettable music experience and memory in my life was attending Sam Hui's 2008 concert in the Arena of Stars in Genting Highlands, Malaysia, which was also the first concert I ever attended.

I was a senior secondary school student at the time, and my whole family travelled across states to Genting to attend the concert. The most memorable moment of the concert was when we, the audience, all waved a paper boat made of fluorescent paper to create an atmosphere during Sam Hui's performance of the song "Paper Boat" ([《纸船》]{lang=zh}).

Sam Hui is my father's favourite singer, so I grew up listening to his music. I also learnt Cantonese during my secondary school years by watching a lot of Hong Kong films and TV shows as well as listening to Cantonese music — including Sam Hui's songs. Therefore, although I would not call myself a Sam Hui fan, his music has had a huge influence on me, and I am glad that I had the opportunity to watch him perform live.

The 2008 concert in Arena of Stars also featured Ricky Hui, one of Sam Hui's brothers, as a guest. The Hong Kong films I watched during my secondary school years included several of the Hui brothers' works, but that concert was the first time I heard Ricky Hui sing. Sadly, Ricky Hui passed away a few years later in 2011, so I am fortunate to have the chance to see him perform live while he was still alive.
