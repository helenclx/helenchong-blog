## Preparing for Student Showcase Presentation

I mentioned in [my previous weekly recap post](2026-01-18-weekly-recap.md) that I and two other classmates were invited by the campus staff of my school, a Malaysian campus of 42 the computer science school to take part in a student showcase in an upcoming school event on January 28 and present our projects and share our 42 school journey.

On the past Thursday, the school staff held a shared session with us to prepare for our presentation, by giving us guidelines for how to present in the event, such as what to include in our slideshows and speech.

## Games I Was Playing

I had beaten the base game of {{ cite "Pokémon Legends: Z-A" }} in December 2025, and it became my favourite {{ cite "Pokémon" }} game on the Nintendo Switch, so I take my time to go through the post-game.

Currently, I have done 8 reward matches in the Infinite Z-A Royale. In the past week, I finished the post-game quests "The One That Gives" and "The One That Takes", and finally caught a Beldum, which has a notoriously low catch rate.

## Web Browsing Highlights

Interesting things I have discovered on the web this week:

- ["A Game Doesn't Need To Be ‘By And For Fans’"](https://aftermath.site/life-is-strange-reunion-fans/) by Harper Jay MacIntyre — An article published on [Aftermath](https://aftermath.site/) in response to the announcement of {{ cite "Life is Strange: Reunion" }}, the latest instalment of the {{ cite "Life is Strange" }} video game series. I strongly agree with the article, regarding both the marketing surrounding {{ cite "Life is Strange: Reunion" }} and the pitfalls of art that exists to appease fans.
- [Just the Browser](https://justthebrowser.com/) — A project for de-bloating Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox and Microsoft Edge. I realised after checking out Just the Browser's GitHub repository that the website is built with [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/), the static site generator that built this very blog, too!
- [Spawn a Neko!](https://github.com/SCP-iota/spawn-a-neko) — A widget that you can embed on your website to let users spawn [Neko](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neko_(software))-like kitties the follow the mouse pointer.
