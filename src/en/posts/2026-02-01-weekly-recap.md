## My Student Showcase Presentation

My school, 42 Malaysia, just held a roadshow event on Tuesday and Wednesday.

Two weeks ago, I and two other classmates were [invited](https://2026-01-18-weekly-recap.md) by my school's campus staff to take part in a student showcase during the roadshow event, then in last week we [joined a session](https://2026-01-25-weekly-recap.md) hosted by the campus staff to prepare for our presentation.

At last, after two weeks of preparation, on the past Wednesday we got the opportunity to present ourselves in front of a bunch of industry partners of our school, mainly from the education industry, to showcase one of our projects and shared our journey at 42 the school.

Fortunately, this was not my first time presenting myself in front of a public; I have had experience doing so in both physical and online events. We needed to deliver our presentation in 5 minutes, so it was not too demanding, and I was fairly satisfied with my performance. After the roadshow event, some members of the 42 Malaysia staff praised my presentation. In conclusion, my presentation was a success!

## Virtual Private Server Access Problems

Unfortunately, not everything went smoothly for me in this week. I encountered a major unexpected setback when I woke up in the morning on Monday: I was unable to access my main virtual private server (VPS), which hosts all my websites, including this one, and most of the self-hosted apps I use, and I could not visit any of my websites. On the other hand, I can still access my other VPS, which I rented from a different provider.

I opened a support ticket to [Deluxhost](https://deluxhost.net/), the provider of my main VPS, as I suspected the possibility of the issue being caused by the provider misconfigured my server, with a detailed technical log produced by my attempt to access the server with secure shell (SSH) which would hopefully help them figure out the cause.

Fortunately, I have always kept local backup copies of my VPS data, and I took notes about how I set up my VPS, so I temporarily worked around the issue of my websites and self-hosted apps not being accessible by moving them to my other VPS, which I rented form [Chunkserve](https://chunkserve.com/).

After some back-and-forth between the Deluxhost support and I, I could finally access my Deluxhost VPS again since Thursday, though Deluxhost support did not reveal what they did to solve my issues.

Since my main VPS is back to normal, I moved my websites and most of the self-hosted apps I use back to the server.

## Games I was Playing

I continued to play {{ cite "Animal Crossing: New Horizons" }} and {{ cite "Pokémon Legends: Z-A" }}. In the latter, I have finished the post-game main missions by winning 15 reward matches in the Infinite Z-A Royale and catching Zygarde, then started the Mega Dimension DLC.

## Web Browsing Highlights

Interesting things I have discovered on the web this week:

- ["The pioneering path of Augustus Tolton, the first Black Catholic priest in the US – born into slavery, he’s now a candidate for sainthood"](https://blknewsnow.com/the-pioneering-path-of-augustus-tolton-the-first-black-catholic-priest-in-the-us-born-into-slavery-hes-now-a-candidate-for-sainthood/) by Annie Selak, published on [BLK News Now!](https://blknewsnow.com/).
