Inspired by the weekly and monthly recap posts by other bloggers, I decided to start writing such form of blog posts myself as a way to share what I have been up to, and interesting things I have discovered.

## Quarterly School Gathering and Open Day

This had been a busy week at school. On Wednesday, my school — a Malaysian campus of [42 the computer science school](/topics/42-the-school/) was hosting its first quarterly school gathering in 2026, where the campus staff shared updates and announced upcoming events at the school.

On Saturday, my campus hosted the year's first quarterly Open Day. Some classmates and I volunteered to help to welcome newcomers to learn about our school on that day.

On my end, at the moment, I am the one who has progressed the furthest in our core curriculum among my classmates, with my current projects being about Python fundamentals. In addition, I was invited by the campus staff to take part in a student showcase in an upcoming event on January 28, when the school engages with industry partners, to present one of my projects and share my 42 school journey. Two other classmates were also invited to present their projects and shared their experience during the event.

## Games I Was Playing

{{ cite "Animal Crossing: New Horizons" }} released Version 3.0 on January 14, so I took the opportunity to pick the game back up again and return to my island. I immediately started to explore the resort hotel that was added in this new free update, decorate the hotel, and launched an opening ceremony for the hotel.

Fun fact: Not only I own a physical copy of {{ cite "Animal Crossing: New Horizons" }}, which I purchased from a local game store, but also I bought the game alongside the Animal Crossing: New Horizon Edition of Nintendo Switch 1!

## Web Browsing Highlights

Interesting things I have discovered on the web this week:

- A [Kickstarter campaign for creating a .meow top-level domain](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/dotmeow/meow-next-round-gtld-application), where the profits would be used to fund the LGBTQIA+ community. The campaign's fundraising goal was achieved! I wholeheartedly support the mission, and I hope dotMeow Foundation's application to ICANN to launch and operate the .meow TLD goes well.
