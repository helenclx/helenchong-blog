Ever since I met my uncle's dog, Bak Baan, for the first time in late January 2025 during [Lunar New Year](2025-02-06-my-2025-lunar-new-year.md), seeing Bak Baan has become what I look forward to most when we visit our family's durian plantation, for which my uncle is the main caretaker, in my parents' hometown.

In early April, during the [Qingming Festival](2025-04-06-my-2025-qingming.md), I learned that Bak Baan was pregnant, and then in late April, my uncle informed us that Bak Baan gave birth on April 29. Since then, my uncle occasionally shared about Bak Baan's puppies, often with pictures or videos, with my parents, often with pictures or videos who in turn share with me.

Bak Baan gave birth to seven puppies, but unfortunately, she lost two of them to a car that hit and killed them. Another one of Bak Baan's children got injured by another car, and according to my uncle, Bak Baan would bark with hostility at any vehicle not belonged to him that passed by the durian plantation.

Since learning that Bak Baan has become a mum, I had been looking forward to seeing her children myself one day. My wish came true recently on August 13, when we needed to travel to my parents' hometown to handle some official paperwork for our family's durian plantation. Naturally, we took the opportunity to visit the plantation. Naturally, the highlight of this visit for me was seeing Bak Baan again, and finally seeing her children for the first time.

Bak Baan's puppies are almost four months old, so they can already see and run, and bark alongside their mum when other dogs approached the plantation. I did not get the opportunity to take photos of Bak Baan and all her five children together, especially since our durian plantation is a huge place, and Bak Baan and her puppies moved around often, but I still managed to snap some photos of them.
