In October 2024, [Anne Sturdivant](https://anniegreens.lol) hosted the [first WeblogPhoMo](https://weblogpomo.club/challenges/weblogphomo-october-2024), a short-term photo challenge. I decided to take part in it because not only [I am a member of omg.lol](2024-10-19-omg-lol-membership-one-month-anniversary.md), and thus I have [my own some.pics page](https://helenchong.some.pics/) to share my own pictures, but also the flexibility of not requiring to post something new every day. Furthermore, I do like photography and want to make good use of the camera of my Redmi Note 13 Pro 5G, which I purchased in August.

Below are the photos I submitted to the WeblogPhoMo October 2024 challenge.

My first entry was a photo of my dog, Yat Tong, sitting down. He loves to sit down, so he does not even need to be trained to do so, LOL.

I learned about the concept of [rubber duck debugging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging) when I took the [CS50's Introduction to Computer Science](https://www.harvardonline.harvard.edu/course/cs50-introduction-computer-science) online course by Harvard University in 2023. In addition to childhood nostalgia for rubber ducks, the concept of using rubber ducks to help with programming actually inspired me to buy rubber ducks.

Rubber duck debugging also makes as a good photography subject, since you can photograph your rubber duck "studying" your code.

Being Chinese, white rice is a staple of my household, including our dog, so I photographed Yat Tong enjoying white rice as his dinner.

Yat Tong likes to sploot when he is relaxing.

Confession: I did not know about the term "splooting" until I searched the web about the pose to figure out how to describe the pose to add image descriptions to these photos. In my household, we referred to the pose as a ‚Äúroasted suckling pig pose‚Äù after my mother pointed out the posture's resemblance to a roasted suckling pig. üòÖ

Another posture Yat Tong likes to take when he is relaxing is lying on the floor with his body straight and his back legs tucked. I refer to this as a "crocodile pose". üòÜ

I love having meals at a local coffee shop and restaurant named The Toast, not only for their quality food and coffee, but also for their coffee cup that greets you "hi" as you enjoy your cup of coffee.

Deepavali is a major cultural event and an official holiday in Malaysia, so during the Deepavali season, you can see Deepavali decorations, including kolams, in shopping malls and supermarkets here in Malaysia.

Coincidentally, in 2024, both Deepavali and Halloween are on October 31. However, Halloween is not widely celebrated in Malaysia.

The above photo of a kolam and a peacock statue was taken in the Mid Valley Southkey shopping mall.
