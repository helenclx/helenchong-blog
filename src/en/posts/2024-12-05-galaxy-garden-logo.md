I have designed a logo for Galaxy Garden, my personal blog!

The Galaxy Garden logo consists of a light yellow minimalist shape of a galaxy resembling the capital G, the first letter of both the "Galaxy" and "Garden", on top of a purple background. The colours were chosen because purple is my favourite colour (along with black) and I find yellow complement purple well.

I made this logo for Galaxy Garden in Affinity Designer 2. The galaxy shape that resembles the capital G was modified from a [galaxy SVG vector](https://www.svgrepo.com/svg/54167/galaxy) from [SVG Repo](https://www.svgrepo.com/).

Designing a logo is not necessary for a personal blog, but I still want to make use of my graphic design skills that I learned from my previous profession as a graphic designer to give my websites and blogs my own identity.
