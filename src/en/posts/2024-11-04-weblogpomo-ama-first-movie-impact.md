[Anne Sturdivant](https://anniegreens.lol) hosted a new blogging challenge named [WeblogPoMo AMA](https://weblogpomo.club/challenges), which aims to foster writer interactions by asking and answering questions posted by other bloggers. Human interactions is part of why I fell in love with blogging in the first place, so I am interested in this challenge.

I am starting my participation by answering a question, **"What’s the first movie, ever watched that made a big impact on you, for good or bad?"** This question was originally asked by [Gabz](https://gabz.blog/) and answered by [Zachary](https://blog.alpine.day/2024/11/weblogpomoama-2) of the [omg.lol staff](https://home.omg.lol/staff).

While it is not the first movie I ever watched, the first movie I had watched that made a big impact on me was [{{ cite "A Bug's Life" }}](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Bug%27s_Life). The film was released when I was 6, long, long before realising I am actually autistic, but in retrospect, {{ cite "A Bug's Life" }} was my first movie special interest.

As a child, I not only considered {{ cite "A Bug's Life" }} one of my favourite films, but also was invested in it to the extent I lost count of how many times I rewatched the film by playing the CD on my house's television over and over, and I have played two of its tie-in video games — [{{ cite "A Bug's Life" }} platform game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Bug%27s_Life_(video_game)) and [{{ cite "Disney's Activity Center: A Bug's Life" }}](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disney%27s_Activity_Center) on PC, and these games became my childhood favourite video games too.

As for why I loved {{ cite "A Bug's Life" }} as a kid so much, I think it was because it was the first Pixar film I ever watched, meaning it was the first cartoon with a 3D art style I ever watched. Before {{ cite "A Bug's Life" }}, all cartoons I watched were in 2D, so {{ cite "A Bug's Life" }} and Pixar films' 3D art style blew my young mind. Furthermore, while I never considered myself a bug nerd, the concept of a cartoon about exploring, well, bugs' lives, fascinated me as a child, and the film's theme about a group or community banding together to fight back their bullies and oppressors inspired me greatly.

My taste in entertainment media, including movies, have changed drastically since my childhood and adolescence, and my love for {{ cite "A Bug's Life" }} had been tainted by the fact that [both Kevin Spacey, who voiced Hopper, and John Lasseter, the director, were accused of sexual misconduct](https://therottenappl.es/result/movie/9487/A-Bug's-Life), but I have always harboured nostalgia for {{ cite "A Bug's Life" }} for its huge impact on my childhood.
