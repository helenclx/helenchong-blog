Happy Holidays!

Christmas celebration is not a tradition in my family because my parents are not religious, but we always look forward to Christmas season, because Christmas Eve also happens to be my younger brother's birthday. Yes, that means my brother is a Christmas Eve baby, haha. ðŸ˜„

Even after my brother moved out of our hometown to work and live in Singapore, he still makes plans for returning to Malaysia and visit us during Christmas season every year, to celebrate his birthday with us, and this year is no exception. 2024 is also the year my brother turns 30, and thus officially joins me in the 30s club.

I am grateful of the moments of my immediately family gathering and talking together, especially when my brother takes a break and returns from Singapore to visit us.

Hope you have a pleasant holiday season!
