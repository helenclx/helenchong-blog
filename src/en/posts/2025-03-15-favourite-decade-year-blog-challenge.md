I was nominated by [Brandon Jones](https://krrd.ing/) to participate in a blog questions challenge about [favourite decade or year](https://krrd.ing/posts/favorite-decade-or-year-blog-challenge/). Thank you, Brandon!

## If you could relive any decade, which one would you choose and why?

I was born in the early 90s, so I have lived through the 90s, 00s and 10s, and now living through half of 20s. To summarise my life in these decades:

- 90s: Childhood — I learned to use a computer, and my main interests at the time included dinosaurs, {% cite "A Bug's Life" %} (the [first film that left an impact on me](2024-11-04-weblogpomo-ama-first-movie-impact.md)), {% cite "Worms 2" %}.
- 00s: Primary and secondary school period — A decade of mix bag for me. My primary school experience was overall positive, but my secondary school years were the most miserable period of my life due to being bullied in school by a boy classmate for being a "weird" girl with no friends (which in hindsight were because I am autistic, but I did not realise it at the time), then I was betrayed by a girl whom I thought was my best friend to that bully.
- 10s: Adulthood — I attended a private university, then started working. I made the most important personal discoveries by finally realising I am queer and autistic, and officially shifting my politics to the left Unfortunately, for a majority of the decade, I was still struggling with the trauma of bullying and personal betrayal from my secondary school period. I only started to recover from the trauma after I attended therapy during the later half of the decade.
- 20s: The 2020s are not over yet, but this decade is being shaped up to be one of discovering what I want from my life more, by making more major decisions, including leaving my openly queerphobic former church for a queer-affirming church, coding my own website from scratch for the first time, and switching my career path from graphic design to web development. Being officially diagnosed with [retinitis pigmentosa](2024-12-21-living-with-retinitis-pigmentosa.md), an eye condition that causes gradual vision loss, has also made me understand my disabilities more.

To be honest, my life experience has taught me that the past is not inherently better, as the notion that teenage years were the best period of life absolutely *do not* apply to me, so I do not think much about which year or decade in the past I want to relive.

Nevertheless, if I have to choose, I will choose the 90s, as my childhood was overall a happy one, but I would be more interested in experiencing the 90s again as an adult.

## What year holds your fondest memories and why?

I find it difficult to answer, because my fondest memories did not happen in the same year, and I am unable to decide which memory was my fondest.

If I have to choose one year, I guess it would be 2022, when I coded my own website from scratch for the first time, since it made me rediscover my passion for web design, and started me down the path of transitioning my career path from graphic design to web development, as well as exploring and participating in the indie web.

## In what year did you experience your most significant personal growth?

I think it was 2019, when I started to attend therapy. By meeting my first therapist, I learned how to not let my past trauma from my secondary school years drag down my self-worth, letting go of the people who hurt me that were no longer in my life, learned to be open for welcoming new people in my life, and to manage my lifelong cockroach phobia.

## If you could go back to your favourite year, what one event or experience would you most want to revisit?

Related to my answer to the question about my favourite year above, I love to revisit my memory of discovering Neocities and making use of the basic HTML and CSS knowledge I had since my teenage blogging years in the 2000s to code my own website from scratch for the first time.

It cannot be overstated how much the experience of coding my first personal website changed my life both online and offline, and improve my relationship with the web.
