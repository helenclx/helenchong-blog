I am a sucker for coffee and adorable mascots, so combining these two things together is a surefire way to get my attention.

For example, the coffee brand of HWC Coffee.

Recently on May 26, my parents and I went to enjoy coffee at a branch of HWC Coffee in a local shopping mall. This was our first time trying out the brand's coffee, and I had a cup of cappuccino. The coffee was good, though I was even more interested in HWC Coffee's mascot, which was a cat.

The most interesting thing about HWC Coffee is, without a doubt, their coffee cup sleeve, as it was designed to appear as if the cat mascot wraps around the coffee cup. It was both cute and creative, and I love it.

As a bonus, HWC Coffee also gifted us stickers of this adorable cat mascot in different poses.
