Coincidentally, mere hours after [officially launching Galaxy Garden](2024-10-08-welcome-to-galaxy-garden.md), Robert Birming published a blog post titled ["Blog Like a Painter"](https://birming.com/blog-painter/) ([Archived](https://web.archive.org/web/20241009/https://birming.com/blog-painter/)), sharing insights about treating blogging like painting a house to build your blog on your own terms at your own pace.

The timing of Robertâ€˜s post was perfect to serve as a reminder for me to not feel overwhelmed by how many things I need or want to do with this blog right away.

As of publishing this post of mine, Galaxy Garden only has two posts (in English and Mandarin Chinese), a home page, an About page and a Posts page to list all posts on this blog. However, due to this being a multilingual blog, and I had not built a multilingual site before, it took me five days to create this blog from scratch until it was ready to go live officially.

Learning to build a multilingual blog has been a rewarding experience, but it was still a process that took considerable time and effort. Therefore, I figured it would be a good idea to start this blog in a relatively simple form first, without pressuring myself with deadlines or what I must add to Galaxy Garden, since getting this blog started was already a major step and a new beginning of my personal blogging journey.
